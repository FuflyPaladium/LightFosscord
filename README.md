**Just Lightcord client but for https://dev.fosscord.com/ (Open source self-hosted discord api)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord
cd Lightcord
npm run devInstall
npm test
```

*You will have to do that every time you pull/clone*

Lightcord will then launch. If you see the Lightcord icon, you're good to go!

Any time you want to launch, just run:

```bash
npm start
```
